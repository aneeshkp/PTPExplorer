Vector Search Alone vs RAG with LLM
Feature	🔍 Vector DB Only (FAISS)	🤖 With LLM (RAG)
What it does	Finds and returns the most relevant chunks	Retrieves chunks, then uses LLM to generate a response
Response	Raw text excerpts from documents	Synthesized natural-language answers
Understanding	Limited — depends on user’s ability to read	High — LLM interprets and explains
Comparison tasks	You compare manually	LLM compares and summarizes for you
User effort	Higher — you read results	Lower — LLM delivers concise answers
Best for	Exploring raw content	Asking natural questions, comparing versions
Examples	“Show all chunks mentioning egress IP”	“What changed about egress IPs between 4.14 and 4.16?”


Why Use an LLM?

With a vector DB, you’re searching like a smart Ctrl+F. With an LLM, you’re asking a coworker to read and summarize it for you.

🔄 RAG Flow with LLM:
	1.	You ask a question
	2.	Vector DB finds top 3–5 relevant chunks
	3.	LLM reads them
	4.	LLM synthesizes a clear answer (with or without citations)
